| Feb 25 |    9-9:45am     |                                                                                                                                                                                                     I spent some time acquainting myself with the problem set and coming up with ways of solving the problem. I did a lot of brainstorming on appraoches and I think the best idea I have is continuously finding the letter that comes soonest after the current index in both docs. |
| Feb 25 | 9:45am-10:20am  |                                                                                                                                                                                 I started thinking through the idea I had above and began implementing it in code. I got through a first draft and after some running and debugging I was able to get it to run through all of the tst cases super fast, however it only passes testEdgeCase and undercounts for all the other tests. |

I'm also not sure now if my approach will be able to work, or if I need to instead look for a different approach. |
| Feb 25 | 11:15am-11:55am | I realized that working through this problem with a linear approach (like I'm doing now) is likely not as efficient as going for a dynamic programming approach; I realized that my current code overlooks possible substrings that could work, and because there are multiple substrings that should be checked at the same time with differing indexes a linear approach is likely not as viable. I instead started thinking through and coding out draft of a tabulation approach. |

The algorithm runs very fast and passes all of the test cases. I will now try to see if I can write out the longest substrings as well. |
| Feb 25 |   9am-9:30am    |                                                                                                                                             I was able to also get one of the shared longest substrings very fast. I both returned the length of the longest string and printed out one of the longest substrings (by replacing the 2D array of integers with a 2D array of Strings), and still passed all of the tests. I will now try to find all of the longest shared substrings. |
| Feb 25 |   9:30am-10am   |                                                                                                                                                                          I tried to use HashMaps (with Strings as the values) as the values in the 2D array in order to also return all of the shared longest substrings. However, I haven't been able to get this to work quite yet, and I'm currently only returning either 1 or 0 as the longest length for all of the test cases. |
