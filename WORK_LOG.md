| Feb 25 |    9-9:45am    |                     I spent some time acquainting myself with the problem set and coming up with ways of solving the problem. I did a lot of brainstorming on appraoches and I think the best idea I have is continuously finding the letter that comes soonest after the current index in both docs. |
| Feb 25 | 9:45am-10:20am | I started thinking through the idea I had above and began implementing it in code. I got through a first draft and after some running and debugging I was able to get it to run through all of the tst cases super fast, however it only passes testEdgeCase and undercounts for all the other tests. |
