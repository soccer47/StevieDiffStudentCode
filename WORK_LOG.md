I did a lot of brainstorming on appraoches and I think the best idea I have is continuously finding the letter that comes soonest after the current index in both docs. |

I got through a first draft and after some running and debugging I was able to get it to run through all of the tst cases super fast, however it only passes testEdgeCase and undercounts for all the other tests. |

I'm also not sure now if my approach will be able to work, or if I need to instead look for a different approach. |
| Feb 25 | 11:15am-11:55am | I realized that working through this problem with a linear approach (like I'm doing now) is likely not as efficient as going for a dynamic programming approach; I realized that my current code overlooks possible substrings that could work, and because there are multiple substrings that should be checked at the same time with differing indexes a linear approach is likely not as viable. I instead started thinking through and coding out draft of a tabulation approach. |

The algorithm runs very fast and passes all of the test cases. I will now try to see if I can write out the longest substrings as well. |
